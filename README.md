# Restricted-Region-Exact-Design
MATLAB code for a program and GUI that gives D-optimal designs.

There are two folders, one for the program Systematic Search and one for the program One Step.
Systematic search is better. I recommend you always use Systematic Search. The reason for the One Step-folder is so that users might use the code. 

User instructions:
1) Download the folder "Systematic Search".
2) Put the downloaded folder in your MATLAB working directory. (For example: C:\Programs\Matlab\Systematic search)
3) Start MATLAB.
4) Set the MATLAB working path (working directory) to the directory you saved the folder in. (For example: C:\Programs\Matlab\Systematic search)
5) Write DUI in the command window. This runs the GUI (Graphical User Interface) of the program Systematic Search.
6) The program pops up.
7) Start designing experiments!
